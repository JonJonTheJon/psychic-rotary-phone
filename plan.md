# BOBO New Website Plan

PROMPT 1 — Purely Visual / Art Direction / Motion

Design the visual language for a new version of bobodit.com, a high-end digital imaging technician company working in film and television.

Preserve the essence of the existing vector iconography and brand identity, but evolve it into something more playful, confident, and contemporary.

Use a living background made of subtle digital noise and grain that slowly shifts and distorts over time. The motion should feel controlled and intentional—like signal drift, sensor noise, or compression artifacts—not chaotic or decorative. Movement must be extremely slow, atmospheric, and never distracting.

The overall aesthetic should feel cinematic, technical, and tactile. Imagine calibrated monitors in a dark room, data quietly flowing, and images being shaped rather than displayed.

Typography must be crystal clear, modern, and disciplined. Favor short phrases and minimal text, with strong contrast against the animated background.

Avoid generic “tech startup” aesthetics. No flashy gradients, no loud colors, no gimmicks. Restraint and precision matter more than novelty.

The final look should communicate trust, technical mastery, and creative confidence—alive, but never noisy.
