Prompt:

Define the information architecture and user experience for bobodit.com, a professional website for a digital imaging technician company working in film and television.

Prioritize clarity, speed of access, and minimal cognitive load. All essential information—company name, phone number, email, and location—must be visible from anywhere on the site via a persistent header, fixed UI element, or equivalent solution.

Reduce total text content significantly compared to the current website. Every section should be concise, scannable, and focused on key information only.

Structure the projects section clearly into Film and TV categories. High-profile projects must be immediately visible and visually prioritized. Each project should be interactive and link directly to external media such as trailers or clips.

Navigation should be simple, shallow, and intuitive, with as few layers as possible. Users should understand what the company does and how to contact them within seconds.

Design for both desktop and mobile first, ensuring contact information and key projects are equally accessible on all devices.

Avoid unnecessary pages, redundant explanations, or decorative interactions. Function, hierarchy, and clarity take precedence over storytelling.

This prompt tells the model: You’re designing a control panel, not a poster.
